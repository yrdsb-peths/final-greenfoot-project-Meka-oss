Welcome to my RPS AutoBattler where you are challenged to change you chunk of change into 50 points in order to win.

You must use your wits and try your luck out in the the "stables" to create a fortune.

The system is fairly simple, consisting of you choosing your amount to wager, as well as if you think Rock, Paper, or Scissors will win. You must do this all before the timer reaches 4 in order to prevent cheating, however you still have the option to pause the game and take a look at the field.

Reach 50 points or go bankrupt trying, the choice is yours.

(Don't gamble in real life)
